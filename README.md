# Graph based neural operators
This repository contains the code for the two following papers:
- [(GKN) Neural Operator: Graph Kernel Network for Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03485)
- [(MGKN) Multipole Graph Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09535)

## Graph Kernel Network (GKN) 
We propose to use graph neural networks for learning the solution operator for partial differential equations. The key innovation in our work is that a single set of network parameters, within a carefully designed network architecture, may be used to describe mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces and between different finite-dimensional approximations of those spaces. 

## Multipole Graph Kernel Network (MGKN)
Inspired by the classical multipole methods, we propose a multi-level graph neural network framework that captures  interaction at all ranges with only linear complexity. Our multi-level formulation is equivalent to recursively adding inducing points to the kernel matrix, unifying GNNs with multi-resolution matrix factorization of the kernel. Experiments confirm our multi-graph network learns discretization-invariant solution operators to PDEs and can be evaluated in linear time.

## Requirements
